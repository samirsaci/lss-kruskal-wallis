Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a method based on a stepwise approach to process improvements.This approach usually follows 5 steps 
(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) for improving existing process problems with unknown causes.

### Medium Article
In this [Medium Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/lean-six-sigma-data-analytics-with-python-kruskal-wallis-test-3afafa097ed), we will explore how Python can 
replace Minitab (Software widely used by LSS experts) in the Analysis step to test hypotheses and 
understand what could improve the performance metrics of a specific process.

### Scenario
You are the Continous Improvement Manager of a Distribution Center (DC) for an iconic Luxury Maison focusing on Fashion, Fragrances and Watches.
The warehouse receives garments that require final assembling and value-added service (VAS) during the inbound process.
#### Objective
With the support of the R&D team, you designed training for the VAS operators to improve their productivity and reduce quality issues.
#### Question
Does the training have a positive impact on the productivity of operators?
#### Hypothesis
The training has a positive impact on the productivity of VAS operators.
#### Experiment
Randomly select operators and measure the time per batch (Time to finish a batch of 30 labels in seconds) to build a sample of 56 records.
