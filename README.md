### Article
In this [Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/lean-six-sigma-data-analytics-with-python-kruskal-wallis-test-3afafa097ed), we will explore how Python can 
replace Minitab (Software widely used by LSS experts) in the Analysis step to test hypotheses and 
understand what could improve the performance metrics of a specific process.

### Scenario
You are the Continous Improvement Manager of a Distribution Center (DC) for an iconic Luxury Maison focusing on Fashion, Fragrances and Watches.
The warehouse receives garments that require final assembling and value-added service (VAS) during the inbound process.

#### Question
Does the training have a positive impact on the productivity of operators?
#### Hypothesis
The training has a positive impact on the productivity of VAS operators.
#### Experiment
Randomly select operators and measure the time per batch (Time to finish a batch of 30 labels in seconds) to build a sample of 56 records.
