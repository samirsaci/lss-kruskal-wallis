Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a method based on a stepwise approach to process improvements.This approach usually follows 5 steps 
(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) for improving existing process problems with unknown causes.

### Medium Article
In this [Medium Article](https://s-saci95.medium.com/lean-six-sigma-with-python-chi-squared-test-bd61489cb0cb), we will explore how Python can 
replace Minitab (Software widely used by LSS experts) in the Analysis step to test hypotheses and 
understand what could improve the performance metrics of a specific process.

### Scenario
You are the Inbound Transportation Manager of a small factory in the United States.
Your transportation network is simple, you have two routes:
- Route 1: coming from your northern regional hub (with difficult road conditions and busy traffic)
- Route 2: coming from your southern regional hub (with no traffic and a beautiful modern road)

Transportation is managed by an external service provider with a fleet of three trucks (with three different drivers: D1, D2, D3).

#### Problem
When an order is allocated to the northern regional hub the lead time to get the request accepted is 35% higher than the southern hub.
#### Question
Are there drivers avoiding as much as possible to be allocated to the north route?
#### Experiment
We have analyzed the shipments of the last **18 months** to build a **sample of 269 records**.
